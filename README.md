# Next.js Frontend Project

This project is a Next.js application designed to recreate a platform based on scraped content. It features a multi-page structure with enhanced design and animations.

## Project Overview

The Next.js application serves as a frontend platform that integrates and displays content scraped from a target website. It aims to provide a user-friendly interface for accessing and interacting with the scraped data, including text, images, and metadata. The project leverages modern web technologies to ensure a responsive and engaging user experience.

## Purpose and Content

The primary purpose of this project is to recreate a web platform that mirrors the content and functionality of a specific website. By utilizing scraped data, the application presents a comprehensive view of the original site's offerings, including:

- **Textual Content**: Articles, descriptions, and other text-based information extracted from the original website.
- **Images**: Visual elements such as photos, graphics, and icons that enhance the presentation of the content.
- **Metadata**: Additional information about the content, such as titles, descriptions, and tags, which help in organizing and retrieving data efficiently.

The application is structured to provide a seamless user experience, allowing users to navigate through different sections of the content, such as Home, About, Products, News, and Contact. Each section is designed to present specific aspects of the scraped content, ensuring that users can easily find and interact with the information they need.

## Content and Functionality

- **Multi-page Structure**: The application includes several pages such as Home, About, Products, News, and Contact, each designed to present different aspects of the scraped content.
- **Component-based Design**: Utilizes reusable components like `Hero.tsx` and `Impact.tsx` to maintain a consistent design language across the application.
- **Styling and Animations**: Employs Tailwind CSS for styling and `framer-motion` for animations, enhancing the visual appeal and interactivity of the platform.
- **Content Integration**: The application is designed to integrate scraped textual content, prioritizing Static Site Generation (SSG) for efficient data delivery and improved performance.

## Project Structure

-   `src/`: Contains the main source code for the Next.js application.
    -   `components/`: Reusable React components (e.g., `Hero.tsx`, `Impact.tsx`).
    -   `pages/`: Next.js pages (e.g., `index.tsx`, `about.tsx`, `products.tsx`, `news.tsx`, `contact.tsx`).
-   `public/`: Static assets.
-   `styles/`: Global CSS or Tailwind CSS configurations.
-   `package.json`: Defines project metadata and dependencies.
-   `package-lock.json`: Records the exact versions of dependencies.
-   `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`: TypeScript configuration files.
-   `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`: Tailwind CSS and PostCSS configuration.
-   `eslint.config.js`: ESLint configuration for code linting.
-   `vite.config.ts`: Vite configuration (if used, often for development).

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**

    ```bash
    # git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    Navigate to the project root and run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

## Available Scripts

-   **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

-   **Build for production:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    ```

-   **Start the production server:**

    ```bash
    npm run start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

## Design and Content

The Next.js application is being enhanced to feature a multi-page structure with improved design, including:

-   **Multi-page Navigation**: Utilizing `react-router-dom` for client-side routing.
-   **Component-based Design**: `Hero.tsx`, `Impact.tsx`, etc., are examples of modular components.
-   **Styling**: Uses Tailwind CSS, with custom global styles (`index.css`) incorporating gradients and new color schemes.
-   **Animations**: Integrates `framer-motion` for fluid and engaging UI animations.
-   **Content Integration**: Designed to integrate scraped textual content, prioritizing SSG (Static Site Generation) for efficient data delivery.
